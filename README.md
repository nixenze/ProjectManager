I included empty database file and file which has some data in the folder /code  
just rename it to "Schedule_database.db"  
  
This program can keeps project and task in sql database file .db  
but this feature still not complete  
The program can only load and store projects and tasks in the database "but not the depentdent task".  
because when we worked on it. things got more complicated,due to their different schema  
  
we also have no time enough for it. (we both has 2 other projects to work with)
